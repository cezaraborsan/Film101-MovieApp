FILM101

In this project I made an application inspired by several well-known sites for movies such as IMDB, Metacritic, Rotten Tomatoes, using the TMDB API. It is an application that allows the user to search for films / series by category or by the name. On the main page, the user can find the top rated movies and TV series that week, and by clicking on one of these, a modal window opens with more details about it.
