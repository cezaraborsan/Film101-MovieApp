FILM101

By using the TMDB API, I built an application inspired by several well-known sites for movies, such as IMDB, Metacritic, Rotten Tomatoes, which allows users to search for films and series by category or by name. There is a list of the top-rated movies and TV shows on the main page. A modal window displays more details about one of these when you click on it.
